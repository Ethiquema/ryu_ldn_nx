# Using the Overlay

ryu_ldn_nx includes a Tesla overlay that lets you monitor connection status and change settings without leaving your game.

## Requirements

- **Tesla Menu** (nx-ovlloader) must be installed
- The overlay file must be in `switch/.overlays/`

## Opening the Overlay

1. Hold **L + DPad Down + Right Stick Click** simultaneously
2. Tesla Menu will appear
3. Select **ryu_ldn_nx** from the list

## Interface

The overlay displays three sections:

### Status

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Server Status** | Connection state (Disconnected, Connecting, Connected, Ready, Error) |
| **LDN State** | Current LDN state (None, Initialized, Station, etc.) |
| **Session** | Current session info (player count, host/client) |
| **Latency** | Round-trip time to server in milliseconds |

### Server

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Server** | Current server address and port |
| **Force Reconnect** | Press A to disconnect and reconnect to the server |

### Settings

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Debug Logging** | Toggle debug output on/off |

## Status Colors

The server status uses color coding:

- **Green** - Connected and ready
- **Yellow** - Connecting or handshaking
- **Gray** - Disconnected
- **Red** - Error state

## Automatic Updates

The overlay updates automatically every second while open. You can also:

- Press **R** to force an immediate refresh
- Status updates in real-time as you play

## Common Actions

### Check Connection Before Playing

1. Open overlay before starting a game
2. Verify status shows "Ready" (green)
3. Close overlay and start your game

### Reconnect After Network Issue

1. Open overlay
2. If status shows "Disconnected" or "Error"
3. Select "Force Reconnect" and press A
4. Wait for status to become "Ready"

### Monitor During Gameplay

1. Open overlay during gameplay
2. Check "Session" for player count
3. Check "Latency" for connection quality
4. Close overlay to continue playing

## Troubleshooting

### Overlay Not Appearing

- Make sure Tesla Menu is installed correctly
- Check that `ryu_ldn_nx_overlay.ovl` is in `switch/.overlays/`
- Try reinstalling Tesla Menu

### "ryu_ldn_nx not loaded"

This appears when the sysmodule isn't running:

### Status Stuck on "Connecting"

- Check your WiFi connection
- Verify the server is online
- Try "Force Reconnect"
