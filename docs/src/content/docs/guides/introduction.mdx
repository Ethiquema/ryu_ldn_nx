# Introduction

**ryu_ldn_nx** is a Nintendo Switch sysmodule that enables online local multiplayer (LDN) gaming by connecting to Ryujinx LDN servers.

## What is LDN?

LDN (Local Wireless Communication) is Nintendo's protocol for local multiplayer on the Switch. Games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and Monster Hunter Rise use LDN for "local play" features.

Normally, LDN requires players to be physically close to each other. **ryu_ldn_nx** intercepts LDN calls and routes them through an online server, allowing you to play "local" multiplayer games with friends anywhere in the world.

## How it Works

```
┌─────────────┐      ┌──────────────┐      ┌─────────────────┐
│   Game      │────▶│ ryu_ldn_nx   │────▶│  Ryujinx LDN    │
│ (MK8 etc.)  │◀────│  sysmodule   │◀────│    Server       │
└─────────────┘      └──────────────┘      └─────────────────┘
                           │
                    ┌──────┴───────┐
                    │ Tesla Overlay│
                    │  (status UI) │
                    └──────────────┘
```

1. **Game calls LDN services** - When a game tries to create or join a local network
2. **Sysmodule intercepts** - ryu_ldn_nx captures these calls via Atmosphere MITM
3. **Routes to server** - Requests are converted to RyuLdn protocol and sent to the server
4. **Server coordinates** - The server matches players and relays game data
5. **Game plays normally** - From the game's perspective, it's just local play

## Features

- **Transparent operation** - Games work without modification
- **Tesla overlay** - See connection status and configure settings
- **Auto-reconnect** - Handles network interruptions gracefully
